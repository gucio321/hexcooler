# Status
WIP :smile:

**04.11.2025** The first project iteration has just been printed. It has some minor issues (e.g. one missing junction) which however has already been fixed.
I also experienced a skill issue (while exporting the bottom part I didn't export mirrors)
**18.01.2026** The project has been printed almost entirely and is under use. It is missing some minor parts (e.g. the stand - comming soon) but geneerally looks good and is usable.
