# Intro
HexCooler is a laptop cooling stand project designed with a hexagonal pattern.

# BOM
> [!note]
> The BOM is work in progress. It is possible that some materials are missing right now.

> [!imporant]
> I assume you have basic knowledge about 3D printing as well as access to a 3D printer.
> Also, I assume you have basic knowledge about soldering and you have access to a soldering setup.

> I did most purchases in PLN, so USD prices are approximate.

| Item             | Quantity | Price [PLN] | Price [USD] | Notes |
|------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Filaments (PLA)  | 2 * 1 kg (one black and one red - pick whatever colors you want) | 85 | 24 |  |
| Be Quiet! Pure Wings 3 140mm 3-Pin black | 1 | 50 | 14 |  |
| Hex Cooler V1 PCB on [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) | 2 assembled + 3 printed boards | 73.20 | 20 | This is what I paid for USD in my bank. In reality, it was a bit cheaper on JLCPCB (as some of those USD left on my currency account) |
| **Total** | 208.20 | 58 |  |

> [!note]
> I also used some universal pins to connect my fan to the PCB. You can alternatively use goldpins or (not recommended) cut the plug and solder the fan wires directly to the PCB.

# Status
WIP :smile:

**04.11.2025** The first project iteration has just been printed. It has some minor issues (e.g. one missing junction) which however has already been fixed.
I also experienced a skill issue (while exporting the bottom part I didn't export mirrors)
**18.01.2026** The project has been printed almost entirely and is under use. It is missing some minor parts (e.g. the stand - comming soon) but geneerally looks good and is usable.
